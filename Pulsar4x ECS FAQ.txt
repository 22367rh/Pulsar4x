ECS FAQ:

What is ECS?
ECS stands for Entity Component System. read:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system
http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html
Since the game has "Components" and "Systems", to avoid confusion we've changed the name of the ECS "Components" to "DataBlobs"
and ECS "Systems" to "Processors"

Can DataBlobs contain other DataBlobs?
No, DataBlobs should not contain other DataBlobs, but they can however contain Entities, Dictionaries of Entities and Lists of Entities. 



How do I create an new Entity?
Create a new static class in the Factories folder, see the other Factories in the folder for examples.
Note that the class should be:
public static
Should take an EntityManager class (though this can in some cases be derived from an Entity).
Return an Entity.

In most cases you'll be passing in a faction entity.
to create the entity itself, you'll need a list of DataBlobs that make up the entity.
the entity is then created in the following manner: Entity foo = Entity.Create(entityManager, listofDataBlobs);

Note that an entity can have only one datablob of a given type

What EntityManager should be used to create an Entity?
That depends on what the entity does and where it operates: 

12:40 <Rod-Serling> Facitons, ShipClasses, Technologies, Species, ComponentDefs
12:40 <Rod-Serling> All stuff that should be on the GlobalManager
12:40 <Rod-Serling> Ships, Populations, Components, those are things that should be on a system manager.
12:41 <Rod-Serling> Ships needs a shipyard entity to spawn at, you're going to be getting the shipyard location, so pass in the shipyard entity and use it's manager.
12:41 <Rod-Serling> Populations, the planet.
12:41 <Rod-Serling> Components, the ship.
12:42 <Rod-Serling> SystemManager is for concrete things
12:42 <Rod-Serling> GlobalManager is for blueprints, prototypes, and ideas.

[2015-04-13 12:40:24] <Rod-Serling> Lines 222-225 in Game.cs
[2015-04-13 12:41:26] <Rod-Serling> To add a processor to that list, add it manually around lines 99-102 of Game.cs
